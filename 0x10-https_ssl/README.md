# https and ssl termination
## Description
This project focuses on configuring subdomains, enabling SSL termination with HAProxy, and enforcing HTTPS traffic.

## Requirements
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Bash scripts must be executable and pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7).
* HAProxy version 1.5+.
* A README.md file is mandatory.

## Tasks
0. World Wide Web
   * Configure subdomains (`www`, `lb-01`, `web-01`, `web-02`) to point to respective IPs.
   * Write a Bash script (`0-world_wide_web`) to audit subdomains.
   * Must use `awk` and a Bash function.

1. HAProxy SSL Termination
   * Configure HAProxy to handle SSL traffic on port 443.
   * Serve encrypted traffic for the `www` subdomain.
   * The root page must display "ALX".
   * Configuration file: `1-haproxy_ssl_termination`.

2. Enforce HTTPS
   * Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS with a 301 status code.
   * Configuration file: `100-redirect_http_to_https`.

## Usage
Run the scripts and test HAProxy configurations using tools like `dig`, `curl`, and `openssl`.
